# Data-Sprawl


“Data Sprawl” is a speculative wearable by Catherine Mee that  intends to provoke discussion about surveillance, 
and privacy in the context of smart cities. The project speculates about concerns related to these issues, 
and explores possible scenarios that could arise within the context of a smart city. 
When wearing the Data Sprawl the wearer is notified when the location of their smart phone is being broadcasted, 
and the peak of the hat lights up every time their location is known.

Embedded in the hat is a Raspberry Pi that scans a smartphone for location packets being broadcasted. 
Each time the location is broadcasted, the Rasberry Pi sends a signal back to the hat, which lights up, 
and illuminates the wearer. 
This project aims to spark debate surrounding the ongoing issues regarding privacy and surveillance and to spark discussion 
into how these concerns should be for future city habitants.
